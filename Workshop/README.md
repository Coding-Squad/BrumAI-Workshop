# BrumAI Rasa Workshop

These are the code files which we are going to use and edit live during the workshop. You don't need to do anything with these files for now, simply have them on your computer ready for the workshop :)

If you prefer using an example with full working code or if you would like to check something after the workshop, this repo contains a directory **Workshop (worked out example)** which contains all files used in this workshop with fully functioning code, and a full written tutorial in Tutorial.ipynb file.
