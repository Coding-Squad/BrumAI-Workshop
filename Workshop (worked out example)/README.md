# BrumAI Rasa Workshop

This directory contains the fully working code files which are going to be used during the BrumAI workshop. All files included in this directory are completed and working. The only thing which you have to take care is to get your apixu api Key which you can get by signing up at https://www.apixu.com/. This api Key will have to be provided in actions.py file and will be used to make an api call.

The file called Tutorial.ipynb is a written step-by-step tutorial which can be used as a reference file.
